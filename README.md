# Squishmoid
- A way to add sparsity to the activation function sigmoid, squishmoid takes the function of sigmoid and adjusts the alhpa factor to be a larger number and as it seems the larger that number the more sparse it can become. 

- With the assistance of Xu Ma and Andrew  , I was able to rewrite the code for ResNet50 with the adjustments of my "Squished" Sigmoid.
